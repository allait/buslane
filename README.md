Buslane
=======

Using data from http://lothianbuses.com and http://mybustracker.co.uk shows a time-lapse data
visualization of Edinburgh bus routes.

Notes
-----

Bus speeds are constant between the start and end points and are based on total route length and
travel time only.

Bus departure and arrival times are from weekday timetables, so weekend only services are missing.
